         <h3>Menu App</h3>
         <p>The Menu App is a React application that displays a restaurant menu with various categories and items. It utilizes React components and props to render the menu structure dynamically. One challenge I faced was implementing the category filtering functionality, which I solved by creating a reusable filter component and leveraging JavaScript's built-in array methods.</p>

         <h3>Todo App</h3>
         <p>This project is a Todo application built with React. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. I utilized React hooks and components to create a modular and reusable codebase. One challenge I faced was implementing the delete functionality, which I solved by passing a callback function from the parent component to the child component.</p>

         <h3>Exercise App</h3>
         <p>The Exercise App is a React application that helps users track their workout routines and exercises. It incorporates features such as exercise logging, progress tracking, and user authentication. One challenge I encountered was integrating a backend API for data storage and retrieval, which I overcame by using React's built-in fetch API and managing the application's state effectively.</p>

         <p>This project is a Quiz application developed with React. It presents users with a series of questions and allows them to submit answers and view their scores. I focused on creating an engaging user interface and implementing dynamic question rendering and scoring logic. One challenge I faced was managing the application's state across multiple components, which I solved by using React's context API.</p>

         <h3>React Native Weather App</h3>
         <p>This is a mobile application built with React Native that fetches and displays weather information based on the user's location. I utilized the Geolocation and OpenWeatherMap APIs to retrieve location data and weather details. The main challenge was integrating the APIs and handling asynchronous data fetching, which I overcame by using React hooks like useState and useEffect.</p>

         <h3>Landing Page Design</h3>
         <p>This is a landing page design I created using Figma. The objective was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page for a fictional product. I focused on creating a clean and modern design with a strong brand identity. One challenge I faced was finding the right balance between aesthetics and functionality, which I addressed by conducting user testing and iterating on the design.</p>

         <h3>Mobile App UI Design</h3>
         <p>In this exercise, I designed the user interface for a mobile app using Adobe XD. The app's purpose was to help users track their daily water intake. I focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that encourages users to stay hydrated. One challenge I faced was designing for different screen sizes and resolutions, which I addressed by following best practices for responsive design.</p>
